# Week 5–6: Control Validation Lab

## Objective
To experimentally validate whether identity-centric controls, network segmentation, and observability mechanisms mitigate the STRIDE threats identified in Weeks 3–4.

## Scope
This lab focuses on access control enforcement, architectural trust boundaries, and security observability rather than vulnerability exploitation.

## Research Contribution
This work provides empirical evidence supporting secure-by-design distributed cloud architectures, bridging threat modelling with live control validation.

## Dependencies
- Week 1–2: Secure Architecture Design
- Week 3–4: STRIDE Threat Modelling
