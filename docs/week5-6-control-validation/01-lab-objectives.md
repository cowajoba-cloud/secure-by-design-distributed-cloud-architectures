# 📝 Lab Objectives – Week 5-6: Control Validation

## Objective

The purpose of this lab is to **validate security controls** in the Secure Distributed Cloud environment using threat modelling insights from Weeks 3-4. This includes:

- Mapping STRIDE threats to implemented security controls.  
- Testing effectiveness of controls in simulated attack scenarios.  
- Documenting observations, results, and any gaps in control coverage.  

---

## Key Goals

1. **Identify critical controls** for each threat category (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege).  
2. **Validate controls** using practical experiments in the lab environment.  
3. **Record results** systematically for analysis in the discussion section.  
4. **Link findings** to diagrams and research notes stored in `07-assets/`.

## Expected Outcomes

- Comprehensive **control mapping table** linking threats to security controls.  
- Evidence of control effectiveness or weaknesses.  
- Actionable recommendations for improving security posture.
