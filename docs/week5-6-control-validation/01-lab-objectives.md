# 🎯 Week 5–6: Control Validation Objectives

## 5.1 Purpose

The objective of Weeks 5–6 is to empirically validate the effectiveness of implemented detection controls under controlled adversarial simulation.

This phase transitions from theoretical modelling to measurable security validation.

---

## 5.2 Validation Goals

The experiments aim to evaluate:

- Authentication abuse detection capability
- Log ingestion integrity
- Alert generation accuracy
- Detection latency
- Rule transparency and forensic visibility

---

## 5.3 Research Questions

1. Does the monitoring system detect repeated SSH authentication failures?
2. Are alerts generated in near real-time?
3. Is rule-level telemetry sufficient for forensic investigation?
4. What limitations exist within a single-node deployment?

---

## 5.4 Experimental Methodology

Each experiment follows:

1. Baseline validation
2. Controlled attack execution
3. Alert observation
4. Rule analysis
5. Evidence documentation
6. Analytical interpretation
