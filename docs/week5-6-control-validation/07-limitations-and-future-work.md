# 07 — Limitations and Future Work

## 1. Experimental Constraints

- Limited hardware resources
- Single monitoring stack
- Simulated rather than real-world traffic

---

## 2. Detection Accuracy Limitations

- Potential false positives
- Limited adversarial diversity
- No automated response mechanisms tested

---

## 3. Future Enhancements

- Introduce SIEM integration (e.g., Splunk/Azure Sentinel)
- Implement automated response playbooks
- Deploy container-based microservices
- Expand adversary simulation scenarios

---

## 4. Research Continuation

Future work should evaluate:

- Detection latency
- False positive rate
- Control tuning optimization
- Scalability impact

---

## 5. Closing Note

This lab establishes a foundation for empirical security validation in distributed cloud environments.
