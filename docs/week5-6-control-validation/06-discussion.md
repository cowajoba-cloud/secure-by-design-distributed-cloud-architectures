## 5.22 Detection Reliability

The system demonstrated reliable detection of repeated SSH authentication failures.

Rule-level transparency allowed forensic validation of alert origin.

---

## 5.23 Detection Latency

Alert generation occurred within seconds of attack execution.

Latency was considered acceptable for host-based monitoring.

---

## 5.24 Architectural Considerations

Single-node deployment introduces performance constraints.

However, detection capability remained intact under moderate attack simulation.
