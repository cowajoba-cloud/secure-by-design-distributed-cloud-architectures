# 05 — Threat Prioritisation

## 1. Method

Threats were prioritised using:

- STRIDE mapping
- Likelihood estimation
- Impact assessment

---

## 2. High Priority Threats

- SSH brute force (Spoofing)
- Privilege escalation (Elevation of Privilege)
- File tampering (Tampering)
- DoS simulation (Denial of Service)

---

## 3. Medium Priority Threats

- Information disclosure
- Log manipulation

---

## 4. Risk Ranking Summary

| Threat | Likelihood | Impact | Priority |
|--------|------------|--------|----------|
| SSH brute force | High | High | Critical |
| Privilege escalation | Medium | High | High |
| File tampering | High | Medium | High |
| DoS simulation | Medium | Medium | Medium |

---

## 5. Conclusion

These prioritised threats directly shape the experimental validation phase in Week 5–6.
