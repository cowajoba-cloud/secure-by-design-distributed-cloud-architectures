# 🔐 Secure-by-Design Distributed Cloud Architectures

A structured research project focused on designing, validating, and benchmarking detection capabilities in distributed cloud-native environments.

---

# 📌 Research Overview

This project explores:

- Secure architecture design  
- Threat modeling and attack surface analysis  
- Control validation using real-world attack simulation  
- Detection engineering and SIEM validation  
- Empirical benchmarking of detection performance  

---

# 🧠 Research Progression

## 🏗️ Weeks 1–2: Architecture Design
- Designed distributed cloud architecture  
- Defined trust boundaries and system components  

---

## ⚠️ Weeks 3–4: Threat Modeling
- STRIDE analysis  
- Attack surface identification  
- Adversary modeling  

---

## 🛡️ Weeks 5–6: Control Validation
- Deployed Wazuh SIEM  
- Simulated SSH brute-force attacks  
- Validated detection rules  
- Confirmed log ingestion pipeline  

📸 Evidence includes:
- Attack execution logs  
- Wazuh alert correlation  
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping  

---

## 🧪 Weeks 7–8: Detection Validation & Benchmarking

Focus:
> Moving from functional validation → performance validation

### Key Activities:
- File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) validation  
- SSH brute-force detection  
- End-to-end detection pipeline verification  
- Alert investigation and correlation analysis  

### Key Outcomes:
- Verified full detection pipeline:
  - Attack → Logs → Wazuh Agent → SIEM → Alert  
- Confirmed real-time detection capability  
- Identified limitations in detection benchmarking

# 📊 Research Direction

This project is evolving toward:

> A reproducible detection benchmarking framework  
for distributed cloud-native architectures

---

# 🔍 Identified Research Gaps

- Lack of detection latency benchmarking  
- Limited SIEM stress testing  
- No standardized validation frameworks  
- Minimal real-world distributed experimentation  

---

# 🚀 Next Phase

- Detection latency measurement  
- High-volume attack simulation  
- Distributed node benchmarking  
- Empirical performance evaluation  

---

# 🎯 Long-Term Goal

To develop:

> A structured, measurable, and reproducible framework  
for validating detection performance in distributed systems

---

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Wazuh (SIEM & XDR)  
- Kali Linux (Attack Simulation)  
- Ubuntu Desktop (Target System)  
- Hydra (Brute-force testing)  
- VirtualBox (Lab environment)
